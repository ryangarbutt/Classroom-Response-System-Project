# WSU CptS 322 Term Project SPRING SEMESTER 2023

Classroom Response System. Have a team build a classroom response system like iClicker or TopHat. Initial development could focus on the basic infrastructure, such as allowing instructors to design questions and allowing students to answer them. Subsequent development could greatly expand the features to include instructor and student dashboards, custom instruction types and even integration with LMSs. This will keep students participating in class and help teachers check student's understanding of the material
